    <h4 class="acaraje-desc">A delicious acarajé</h4>
    
    <p>Acarajé is a gastronomic specialty of African and Afro-Brazilian cuisine.</p>
    <p>It is a dumpling made of black-eyed pea dough, onion and salt, and fried in palm oil.</p>
    
    <h3 class="acaraje-ingredients">Ingredients:</h3>
    
    <ul class="acaraje-dots">
        <li>1,10 lb of raw black-eyed peas</li>
        <li>1,10 lb of onion</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 small onion with skin</li>
        <li>16.90 fl oz of oil</li>
        <li>16.90 fl oz of palm oil</li>
        <li>2 cups of vatapá</li>
        <li>0.33 lb of dry shrimp</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step by step</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Place the whole beans in a food processor and pulse for a few seconds to break up the beans.</li>
        <li>Be careful to dont crumble.</li>
        <li>Place the beans in a bowl and cover with water.</li>
        <li>Soak for at least 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Shake the beans with a spoon and with a sieve, remove all the husks that come off the beans.</li>
        <li>After removing the skins enough, wash the beans under running water and continue removing the rest of the skins.</li>
        <li>Reserve.</li>
        <li>Peel the onions.</li>
        <li>Cut into pieces.</li>
        <li>Reserve.</li>
        <li>In a food processor, place the beans and onions.</li>
        <li>Blend for 3 minutes, or until you get a smooth, uniform paste.</li>
        <li>Remove all the paste from the food processor and place it in a large, deep pan.</li>
        <li>With a wooden spoon, beat the acarajé mass until the mass triples in volume.</li>
        <li>This process is quite time consuming but it is very important for fermentation.</li>
        <li>Place the oil, palm oil, and the unpeeled onion in a medium saucepan and heat over high heat.</li>
        <li>With two tablespoons, shape the acarajés: fill one of the spoons with the dough, move from one spoon to the other until the dough is in the shape of a cupcake.</li>
        <li>Place the dumplings in the hot oil and fry for 3 minutes on one side.</li>
        <li>With a slotted spoon, turn the dumplings and fry until golden.</li>
        <li>Adjust the oil temperature.</li>
        <li>If necessary, lower the flame so that the oil does not burn.</li>
        <li>Remove the dumplings with a slotted spoon and place on absorbent paper.</li>
        <li>Cut the dumplings in half and fill with vatapá.</li>
        <li>Place the dried shrimp inside the acarajé and close.</li>
        <li>Serve next.</li>
    </ol>
